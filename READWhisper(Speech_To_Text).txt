Here is a step-by-step guide on how to convert speech to text in Python using the Whisper library in PyCharm:
Installation

Install the Whisper library: Open the terminal in PyCharm and type in the following command to install the Whisper library:
pip install whisper
Importing and Creating Function

Import the library: In your Python code, add the following line to import the Whisper library:
import whisper

Record audio: Use the whisper.record function to record audio. For example, the following code will record 5 seconds of audio and save it as a wav file:
Program
1
audio = whisper.record(duration=5)
audio.export("recording.wav", format="wav")
Transcribe the audio: Use the whisper.Transcriber class to transcribe the recorded audio. For example, the following code will transcribe the audio file we just recorded and print the transcribed text:
2
transcriber = whisper.Transcriber("recording.wav")
result = transcriber.transcribe()
print(result.text)
(Optional) Customize the transcriber: You can also customize the transcriber to fit your needs. For example, you can set the language, the sample rate, and the key words to transcribe. Here's an example:
makefile
3
transcriber = whisper.Transcriber("recording.wav")
transcriber.sample_rate = 16000
transcriber.language = "en-US"
result = transcriber.transcribe(keywords=["hello", "world"])
print(result.text)
And that's it! You have successfully transcribed speech to text in Python using the Whisper library in PyCharm.
