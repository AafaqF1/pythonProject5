To convert text to speech using wincl library and save it to an MP3 file, you can use the following steps in Pycharm:

Install the wincl library by running the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
pip install wincl and win32com
Import the wincl library in your Python script.

import comtypes.client
import wincl
Initialize the Speaker object from the wincl library.

speaker = wincl.Dispatch("SAPI.SpVoice")
Set the voice of the speaker object to the desired language using the Voice property.
 You can use the following code to see the list of available voices and their corresponding language IDs:

fspeak = comtypes.client.CreateObject("SAPI.SpVoice")
filestream = comtypes.client.CreateObject("SAPI.spFileStream")

To convert the text to speech and save it to an MP3 file, use the SpeakToWaveFile method:

filestream.open("outputwin32com.wav", 3, False)
speak.AudioOutputStream = filestream
speak.Speak("Hey I am Aafaq Fazal and i am Working in Datalytice company which is top Data science company in islamabad")
filestream.close()

This will create an MP3 file named sample_speech.mp3 in the same directory as your Python script.
The file will contain the speech generated from the text.
