 Read Me File How To Convert Speech To Text USing PyGame Library
Here's how you can convert a text file to a speech file and change the pitch using pygame in PyCharm:
Installation

Install The Libraries
pip Install oygame
pip install gTTs

Import the pygame library and the gTTS library in your Python code:
import pygame
from gtts import gTTS

Initialize the mixer:
pygame.mixer.init()

Read the text file and store it in a variable:
with open("text_file.txt", "r") as f:
    text = f.read()
Use the gTTS library to convert the text to an MP3 file, and specify the pitch using the pitch parameter:
speech = gTTS(text, pitch=1.5)
speech.save("speech.mp3")

Load the MP3 file using pygame.mixer.music.load:
pygame.mixer.music.load("speech.mp3")
Play the MP3 file using pygame.mixer.music.play:
pygame.mixer.music.play()

Wait for the speech to complete:
while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy():
    pygame.time.Clock().tick(10)

This is a basic example of how to convert a text file to a speech file and change the pitch using pygame in PyCharm.
You can further customize the code to suit your specific needs, such as changing the language, speed,
and other options of the gTTS object
