Here's a step-by-step guide on
how to convert text to speech in Python using the pyttsx3 library in PyCharm:

Installation
Install the pyttsx3 library by running
pip install pyttsx3 in your command prompt/terminal.

Open PyCharm and create a new project.

In your PyCharm project, create a new Python file and name it text_to_speech.py.
Importing and Performing Function

Import the required module by adding the following code to your file:

import pyttsx3
Initialize the text-to-speech engine using the following code:

engine = pyttsx3.init()

Set the properties of the speech such as the rate, volume, and voice:

Set the rate of speech

rate = engine.getProperty('rate')
engine.setProperty('rate', rate-50)

Set the volume of speech

volume = engine.getProperty('volume')
engine.setProperty('volume', volume+0.25)

 Get the list of available voices

voices = engine.getProperty('voices')

Select a voice

engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)
Pass the text that you want to be converted to speech as an argument to the say() method:

Convert the text to speech

engine.say("Hello, I am Datalytice. How can I help you today?")

Finally, call the runAndWait() method to execute the text-to-speech conversion:


Execute the text-to-speech conversion

engine.runAndWait()

Save the file and run it in PyCharm. You should hear the text being converted to speech.
